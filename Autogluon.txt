	Unused Original Features (Count: 1): ['col4']
		These features were not used to generate any of the output features. Add a feature generator compatible with these features to utilize them.
		Features can also be unused if they carry very little information, such as being categorical but having almost entirely unique values or being duplicates of other features.
		These features do not need to be present at inference time.
